# CloudTools
A collection of tools for operations and patterns applicable to Cloud Platforms.

It currently supports Windows Azure (because that's what I'm working with).

_Note_ that the code here is still pre-release. It was forked off of my work at Eirtight where it was implemented during my free time, in order to allow 3rd party improvements, suggestions and criticism. This file will be replaced with a formal introduction.
